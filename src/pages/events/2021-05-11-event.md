**Verdi’s *La traviata***

4, 5, 7, 8, 10 August 2021

A passionate love story in a timeless setting. At the centre of it all stands the beautiful Violetta, the courtesan who finds true love in Alfredo Germont. Will they be forced to sacrifice their happiness to the hypocrisy of high society?

NHO is joined for *La traviata* by Manchester Camerata (“probably Britain’s most adventurous orchestra” – *The Times*).

In order to ensure the most enjoyable and safest possible experience for our artists and audiences, our opera festival this summer will take place outside. **[Read more about what to expect](https://www.nevillholtopera.co.uk/news/nho-summer-opera-festival-2021).**
