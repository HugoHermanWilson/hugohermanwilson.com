This work tells the dramatic story of the prophet Elijah. It was performed by Todmorden Choral Society and Todmorden Orchestra, conducted by Antony Brannick. The soloists were Hugo Herman-Wilson, who gave an expressive and beautiful performance as Elijah, Eleanor Sanderson-Nash, Sophie Dicks, and Adam Magee, along with some soloists from the Choral Society itself.

The choir, orchestra and soloists gave a brilliant performance of a long and demanding work, in which dramatic and peaceful music both featured.
