###### Brundibár: A Children's Opera

Brother and sister Aninku and Pepíček are on a quest to raise money to help their sick mother, but an evil musician Brundibár stands in their way...

With the help of a fearless sparrow, keen cat, and wise dog, they must defeat him with the power of music to set the village free!

A magical musical adventure full of friendship, hope and community spirit, Brundibár is an opera for all the family.

**Also included with this event is a free Family Opera Workshop** that takes place before the opera begins. Learn to sing the Children's March to help save the day!
