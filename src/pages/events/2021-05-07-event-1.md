A powerful man with a dark side that few can resist, Don Giovanni casts his seductive spell over all those he meets. But as his conquests pile up, ghosts from his past come knocking at his door, threatening to bring him down. Who will have the final word?

NHO will be joined by the brand new Shadwell:Ensemble for *Don Giovanni*.

In order to ensure the most enjoyable and safest possible experience for our artists and audiences, our opera festival this summer will take place outside. **[Read more about what to expect](https://www.nevillholtopera.co.uk/news/nho-summer-opera-festival-2021).**
